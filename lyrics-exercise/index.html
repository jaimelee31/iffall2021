            <p>Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)</p>
            <p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)</p>

            <p>Needless to say, I keep in check</p>
            <p>She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)</p>
            <p>Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)</p>
            <p>Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)</p>
            <p>Needless to say, I'm keeping in check</p>
            <p>She was a bad-bad, nevertheless</p>
            <p>Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck</p>
            <p>Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck</p>
            <p>Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip</p>
            <p></p>Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip</p>
            <p> Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt</p>
            <p>Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt</p>
            <p>Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse</p>
            <p>She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose</p>

            <p class="singer">[Chorus: Swae Lee]</p>
            <p>Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya</p>
            <p>You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much</p>
            <p>Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya</p>
            <p>You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower</p>
            <br>
            <p class="singer">[Verse 2: Post Malone]</p>
            <p>Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh)</p>
            <p>You don't make it easy, no (No, no)</p>
            <p>Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh)</p>
            <p>Give me a reason to, oh (Oh)</p>
            <p>Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh)</p>
            <p>I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh)</p>
            <p>Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)</p>
            <p>Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)</p>
            <p>I know you're scared of the unknown (Known)</p>
            <p>You don't wanna be alone (Alone)</p>
            <p>I know I always come and go (And go)</p>
            <p>But it's out of my control</p>
            <br>

            <p>And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya</p>
