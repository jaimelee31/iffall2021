       <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Jaime Lee, Communication Design Major, Junior.</p>
        <p>2. I am interested in HCI and I thought this course would be a good introduction into coding and web design. I also have never worked with code to design things so I am excited to learn more about that.</p>
        <p>3. I don't have experience with HTML/CSS/JS except for very briefly in Digital Studio, but I took CSE 131 last fall.</p>
        <p>4. I'm hoping to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and about how web developers go through the process of creating a website.</p>
        <p>5. Designing for a screen is different than designing for paper because a the area that someone is looking at your design can vary from a phone to a monitor, and you have to be able to convey information effectively in all situations. There is also room for a lot more interactive components.</p>
        <p>6. I think the <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> website exemplifies effective design because it provides really engaging moving pictures and bright colors that compliment the minimalist tone of the website. </p>
        <p>7. The <a href="https://www.espn.com/">ESPN</a> website exemplifies effective communication because the user can see so much information about different sports and teams in a clear and consise way. The website is also really easy to navigate.</p>
        <p>8. The <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> website works well because it's really easy to tell what the website is trying to get you to do (sign up for rides or sign up to drive). Although these options are geared towards different sides of the market, the design of the website is able to integrate both effectively.</p>
