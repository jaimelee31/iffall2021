                <h1>Texas Hold'em</h1>
                <p>In hold'em, players receive two down cards as their personal hand, after which there is a round of betting. Three board cards are turned simultaneously and another round of betting occurs. The next two board cards are turned one at a time, with a round of betting after each card. The board cards are community cards, and a player can use any five-card combination from among the board and personal cards. A player can even use all of the board cards and no personal cards to form a hand ("play the board"). A dealer button is used. The usual structure is to use two blinds, but it is possible to play the game with one blind, multiple blinds, an ante, or a combination.</p>

                <h3>Rounds of Betting</h2>
                <p><u>Opening deal: </u>Each player is dealt two cards face down, which are known as hole cards or pocket cards.</p>
                <p><u>First round of betting: </u>Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player can call the big blind, raise, or fold. The big blind has the option to raise an otherwise unraised pot. 
                <p><u>The flop: </u> The dealer burns a card, and then deals three community cards face up. The first three cards are referred to as the flop, while all of the community cards are collectively called the board.</p>
                <p><u>Second round of betting: </u> Starting with the player to the left of the dealer button, each player can check or bet. Once a bet has been made, each player can raise, call, or fold.</p>
                <p><u>The turn: </u> The dealer burns another card, and then adds a fourth card face-up to the community cards. This fourth card is known as the turn card, or fourth street.</p>
