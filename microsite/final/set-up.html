It is possible to play on other surfaces but a poker table is ideal because the cards slide nicely on the felt and the raised edge makes sure nothing will fall off the table.  All players should take a seat and be give the same amount of chips.  All house rules should be discussed such as blinds, antes, and chip values.</p>
